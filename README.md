# Credit-Card-Ensemble-Model
**Developed a credit card fraud detection model that used an Ensemble technique to combine Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF). **
One thing to remember is that the dataset was not balanced since 87% of clients were classified as good payers while only 13% were considered bad profile.
Also, the dataset only had people who actually got the card, not those who were denied at first for other reasons, like unpaid debts. 
This might affect the model's performance in real situations. 
In the future, it would be a good idea to improve the model's ability to say "no" more accurately and consider these imbalances while making the model better.
